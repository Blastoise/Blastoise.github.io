**DESCRIPTION**

The website contains all the basic features. It has loader animation that runs before content loads in Web page. Home page has matrix falling effect made using canvas and it uses audio element for playing/pausing the radio. It also has typewriter effect. The about page along with home page is responsive using flexbox. The projects page used GIF's to demonstrate projects and is made responsive. The skills page uses flip animation to show case skills but is not responsive. The contact page uses Codeforces API for fetching the Ratings and is also not responsive.


**UNIQUE**

I uses canvas element which people generally don't use. I also used audio elements for playing audio which is implemented using JS.


**PROBLEMS FACED**

I got stuck in pausing the audio using same image and also got stuck for flip animation to work in Firefox.


**SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT**

The improvement is required for every page and for each section of the page. I couldn't make all pages responsive because of time constraints so I will work on that. I will also try to implement dynamic fetching of codechef and hackerrank rating using Web Scrapping. I would also implement smooth scrolling to work in other browsers and not only in Chrome.


**WHAT YOU LEARNED**

I learned the advance of HTML and CSS and came to have a glance to the programming language - Javascript which was new for me. Learned how to control the appearance of the page using CSS. I also came to know about WebScraping with python. I also used OMDB API to get the names of the author,etc which is not included in this project.
